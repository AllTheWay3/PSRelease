This repo is a proxy to https://github.com/powershell/powershell for creating on-demand packages when releasing PowerShellCore.

The Jenkinsfile at the root of the repo provides directives to build and package on all supported platforms.

The repo also has scripts to build on specific platforms.

The repo is not intended to be directly used. However one can take a look at the scripts and docker images for reference.
